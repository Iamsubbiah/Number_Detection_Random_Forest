# Number_Detection_Random_Forest
Predict handwritten digits using a Random Forest classifier. Trained on pixel features from images (like the MNIST dataset), the model accurately identifies numbers 0–9, demonstrating how ensemble learning can be applied to image-based digit classification.
📝 Project Description:
This project implements a Random Forest Classifier to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) from image data. The model is trained on a digit dataset (e.g., MNIST) where each digit image is represented by pixel intensity values. By using an ensemble of decision trees, Random Forests offer robust performance even with noisy or complex data.

This project highlights how a classical machine learning approach can efficiently solve digit classification problems without needing deep learning.

🧠 Tech Stack:
Python

Scikit-learn – for Random Forest modeling

Pandas & NumPy – for data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – for development and experimentation

📊 Dataset Used:
MNIST dataset (or similar)

28x28 pixel grayscale images of digits 0 to 9

Each image flattened into a 784-dimensional feature vector

🔁 Workflow:
Load and visualize the dataset.

Preprocess the image data (flattening, scaling if needed).

Split data into training and test sets.

Train a Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluate accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualize predictions and misclassifications.

🎯 Outcome:
The Random Forest model provides high accuracy in detecting handwritten numbers, making it a strong, interpretable baseline for digit classification tasks. It shows how traditional ML can be both powerful and computationally efficient on image recognition problems.

📈 Visual Insights:
Feature importance plots highlight which pixel regions are most influential.

Confusion matrix shows how well each digit is classified.

Random Forest handles variance and overfitting better than single decision trees.
